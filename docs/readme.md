# GDPyS

**Welcome to the GDPyS documentation!**

First off, let's get to know the basic workflow of using GDPyS.
GDPyS is designed for Security, speed, and ease of use, requiring only a mysql database and python.

If you ever want to help out with the documentation, create a PR at [this](https://github.com/electroflameofficial/gdpys) fork.
> **Note:** You ***need*** to be familiar with SQL and Python to be able to fix any errors.

The first part of this documentation is an introduction to the features of GDPyS, divided into courses. I'll be adding more articles On-The-Go as GDPyS Nears its production phase.
