# GDPyS v3 - The modern Geometry Dash Custom Server!
Taking Geometry Dash servers to the moon ðŸš€. GDPyS is an implementation of a Geometry Dash server in modern Python!

## What are the aims of GDPyS
When I set out to create GDPyS, I had two primary goals.

The first goal was to provide outstanding performance. GDPyS prioritises speed and efficiency in every task a user has to face.

The secondary goal of GDPyS is to be security. Recently, the entire community has suffered with mass botting attacks. I believe it is the duty of GDPyS to lead the way for
major renovations  within the GDPS community.
